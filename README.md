Market Sentiment & Feedback Analytics for Onitsha Main Market
Using NLP to Strengthen Local Commerce and Promote Sustainable Market Systems

Introduction
Open markets are not just places of trade—they are vibrant economic ecosystems where customer experiences, product quality, and community interactions shape business outcomes. In large commercial hubs such as Onitsha Main Market, traders often rely on intuition and face-to-face interactions to understand customer needs. However, with the rise of social media, e-commerce, and online customer conversations, valuable feedback is increasingly digital.

The challenge is that most market sellers lack the tools and technical expertise to analyze this large volume of customer feedback. As a result, critical insights about product satisfaction, pricing concerns, counterfeit goods, waste issues, and consumer preferences often remain unnoticed and unused.

The Problem: Limited Access to Data-Driven Insight
Many traders want to understand:
- What customers are complaining about.
- Which products are being praised or rejected.
- Trends in consumer needs across different locations.
- Language-specific concerns, especially in Igbo, Pidgin, and English.

Yet, they face several barriers:
Feedback is unstructured, multilingual, and difficult to process manually. This gap results in inefficient business decisions, wasteful product stocking, and reduced customer satisfaction.

The Solution: Market Sentiment & Feedback Analytics System (NLP-Powered)
This project develops an AI-driven Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that automatically analyzes customer feedback to extract:
- Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Key themes and complaints
- Emerging consumer trends

The pipeline uses transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R, BERTopic) capable of multilingual understanding, including code-switching common in Nigerian markets.

SDG Alignment

1. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure
This system democratizes access to AI-powered insight—allowing local businesses to make informed decisions.

2. SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities
The solution promotes transparency, responsible consumption, and improved community trust in local markets.

Conclusion
This project bridges a long-standing gap between traditional commerce and modern data-driven decision-making. By converting everyday conversations into insights, it strengthens commercial infrastructure, empowers traders, and builds more sustainable market systems.
